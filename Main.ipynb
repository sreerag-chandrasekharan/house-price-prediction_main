    "### 1.1 Problem statment\n",
    "\n",
    "The real estate market lacks transparency and accuracy in house price estimation, making informed decisions difficult. Current methods rely on outdated data and manual evaluations, failing to address the market's dynamic nature. A Machine Learning model can bridge this gap by leveraging property features, location metrics, and historical data to deliver accurate price predictions for better decision-making.\n",

    "To design and implement a machine learning-based system that predicts house prices in Delhi, India with high accuracy."
